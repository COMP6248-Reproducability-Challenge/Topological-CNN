# Topological-CNN

# About

 This report attempted to reproduce the findings in the paper ["Topological Convolutional Neural Networks"](https://openreview.net/forum?id=hntbh8Zo1V) submitted in the  NeurIPS 2020 Workshop on Topological Data Analysis and Beyond. The TCNNs and experiments described in the paper were reimplemented based on the information provided in the orginal report. The ease of reimplmentation as well as reproduced experiment results were used to comment on the reproducibility of the original paper. The filters re-implemented were the KF and CF filters. The experiements, Synthetic experiments and Interpretability, were also reimplemented based on the information provided.
